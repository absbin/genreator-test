Steps to convert .py to .exe in Python 3.6

Install Python 3.6.
Install cx_Freeze, (open your command prompt and type pip install cx_Freeze.
Install idna, (open your command prompt and type pip install idna.
Write a .py program named myfirstprog.py.
Create a new python file named setup.py on the current directory of your script.
In the setup.py file, copy the code below and save it.
With shift pressed right click on the same directory, so you are able to open a command prompt window.
In the prompt, type python setup.py build
If your script is error free, then there will be no problem on creating application.
Check the newly created folder build. It has another folder in it. Within that folder you can find your application. Run it. Make yourself happy.
See the original script in my blog.

setup.py:

from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

base = None    

executables = [Executable("myfirstprog.py", base=base)]

packages = ["idna"]
options = {
    'build_exe': {    
        'packages':packages,
    },    
}

setup(
    name = "<any name>",
    options = options,
    version = "<any number>",
    description = '<any description>',
    executables = executables
)
